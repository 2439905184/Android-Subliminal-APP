# Android-Subliminal-APP
This is a fully functional app I made from scratch to set subliminal mind tuning alarms for everyone that helps to maximize productivity and improve the personal lifestyle of users.

## Features

* Subliminal messages as alarm
* Mix subliminal messages with music
* Set subliminal messages from list of quotes
* process user's speech to set Subliminal message

## Work with Source code
The gradle file contains all the required libraries and configurations that are necessary to build the app, if you are using the latest version of Android Studio and build tools, you may need to optimize the app for it in the `build.gradle` file.
